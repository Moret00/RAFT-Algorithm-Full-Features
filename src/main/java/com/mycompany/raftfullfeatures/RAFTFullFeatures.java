DISCLAIMER: This RAFT implementation includes additional features for simulating real-world distributed systems:

- Dynamic Cluster Reconfiguration: Servers can be added or removed dynamically, with new servers syncing logs from the leader.
- Persistent Log Storage: Logs are saved in a file system or database, allowing recovery after failures.
- Fault Simulation: Simulates leader and follower failures, showing RAFTâ€™s fault tolerance with leader elections and log consistency.
